# Create a model retraining pipeline

## What are we building?

We're going to use the Amazon SageMaker Jupyter notebook environment to create a model retraining pipeline.

## Why are we building it?


### Short Route: Deploy everything for me :see_no_evil:

**Time to complete:** 5-10 minutes.

### Long Route: Build the pipeline yourself :white_check_mark::metal:

**Time to complete:** 15-20 minutes.

## Next step:
Once you're done testing the API call to your model, you can [clean up the resources](../99_Cleanup) so you're not charged.

# New ML Ops Retraining Module
* `./lambda_functions` contains lambda code referenced in the notebook lambda steps
* `./notebooks` contains the new Jupyter notebook used to build the step function workflow

# TODOs
* See "TODOs" in the notebook (2-3)
* Convert Lambda SAM app to CDK app
* Instructions & e2e testing
* Labify it
